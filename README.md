# Analyzing-City-Employee-Salaries
## AI Workforce EDA Project
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between employee experience, salary trends, and workforce distribution using data science techniques.
The analysis leverages Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sympy for:

âœ” Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
âœ” Statistical & Mathematical Insights
âœ” Probability-Based Analysis
âœ” Visualizations of Workforce Patterns

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Source: Employee_Salary_Dataset.csv

Key Features:

Employee_ID â†’ Unique identifier

Name â†’ Employeeâ€™s full name

Experience_Years â†’ Total years of work experience

Salary â†’ Annual salary in INR

Department â†’ Employeeâ€™s department

Role â†’ Job designation

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Highlights
ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis

Distribution of experience years â†’ Most employees fall in the early-to-mid career range.

Distribution of salaries â†’ Salaries are right-skewed, with a few high earners.

ðŸ”¹ Statistical Insights

Correlation between experience and salary is positive, confirming that salary generally grows with experience.

Covariance further validates the positive relationship.

ROI (Return on Investment) was computed as:

ðŸ”¹ Mathematical Modeling

Symbolic differentiation using Sympy was applied to salary functions, helping understand salary growth trends.

ðŸ”¹ Probability-Based Insights

Calculated probability of ROI > 50%, identifying employees who outperform expected salary benchmarks.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion & Insights

ðŸ”¹ Experience vs Salary

Salaries generally increase with years of experience, but the rise is not always linear.

ðŸ”¹ High ROI Employees

Some employees achieve high ROI despite fewer years of experience â†’ indicating high performers.

ðŸ”¹ Departmental Trends

Certain roles/departments consistently offer higher pay, suggesting better career growth opportunities.

ðŸ”¹ Mathematical Insight

Growth patterns modeled with derivatives show diminishing salary growth after a certain experience level.

## âœ… Business Takeaways

Identify high ROI employees for promotions/leadership roles.

Focus training & retention on departments with high growth potential.

Use experience-salary insights for better salary benchmarking.

Recognize diminishing returns at high experience â†’ optimize hiring strategy for a balanced workforce.
